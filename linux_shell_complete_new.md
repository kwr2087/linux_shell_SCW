### Background

Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such as through a keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems. The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a **graphical user interface** (GUI).
With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.

While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.
Imagine the following task:
for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file.
Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell.
The Unix shell is both a **command-line interface** (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast.
With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want.
Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.


### The Shell


The shell is a program where users can type commands.
With the shell, it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn.
While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you're studying.
However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of "words" (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful
pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of
commands can be written into a *script*, improving the reproducibility of
workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.
Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems.
As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,
being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.
We can build on the command-line skills covered here
to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.

Let's get started.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

~~~
$
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The shell typically uses `$ ` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$ `.
Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
*do not type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it.
Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear. 
The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. 
You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

So let's try our first command, `ls` which is short for listing.
This command will list the contents of the current directory:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Command not found
> If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
> will print an error message such as:
>
> ~~~
> $ ks
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> ~~~
> ks: command not found
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command is not installed.
{: .callout}


## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,
has just returned from a six-month survey of the
[North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre),
where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).
She has 1520 samples that she's run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins.
She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called `goostats` she inherited.
On top of this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month so her paper can appear in a special issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.

The bad news is that if she has to run `goostats` by hand using a GUI,
she'll have to select and open a file 1520 times.
If `goostats` takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours of Nelle's attention.
With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses her attention on writing her paper.

The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this.
More specifically,
they explain how she can use a command shell to run the `goostats` program,
using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names,
so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.

As a bonus,
once she has put a processing pipeline together,
she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.

title: "Navigating Files and Directories"
teaching: 30
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I move around on my computer?"

- "Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa."
- "Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories."
- "Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command"
- "Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages."
keypoints:
- "The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk."
- "Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders)."
- "Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree."
- "`cd [path]` changes the current working directory."
- "`ls [path]` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory."
- "`pwd` prints the user's current working directory."
- "`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system."
- "A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location."
- "An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system."
- "Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows."
- "`..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'."
---

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called 'folders'),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.

First let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like *places* - at any time
while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called
our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. 'here', so knowing where you are before running
a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~
{: .output}

Here,
the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`,
which is Nelle's **home directory**:

> ## Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.
> On Linux it may look like `/home/nelle`,
> and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\nelle` or
> `C:\Users\nelle`.
> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)
> In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows
> output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.
{: .callout}
>  
> We will also assume that your `pwd` command returns your users home directory. 
> If `pwd` returns something different you may need to navigate there using `cd` 
> or some commands in this lesson will not work as written. 
> See [Exploring Other Directories](#exploring-other-directories) for more details 
> on the `cd` command.

To understand what a 'home directory' is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of this example, we'll be
illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this
illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.

On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:

![The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories
titled bin, data, users, and tmp](../fig/filesystem.svg)

At the top is the **root directory**
that holds everything else.
We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;
this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.

Inside that directory are several other directories:
`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
`data` (for miscellaneous data files),
`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),
`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`
because `/Users` is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

> ## Slashes
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a path,
> it's just a separator.
{: .callout}

Underneath `/Users`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,
her colleagues *imhotep* and *larry*.

![Like other directories, home directories are sub-directories underneath 
"/Users" like "/Users/imhotep", "/Users/larry" or 
"/Users/nelle"](../fig/home-directories.svg)

The user *imhotep*'s files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`,
user *larry*'s in `/Users/larry`,
and Nelle's in `/Users/nelle`.  Because Nelle is the user in our
examples here, this is why we get `/Users/nelle` as our home directory.
Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in
your home directory to start.

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~
{: .output}

(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating
system and how you have customized your filesystem.)

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory.
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the `-F` **option**
(also known as a **switch** or a **flag**) ,
which tells `ls` to classify the output
by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:
- a trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory
- `@` indicates a link
- `*` indicates an executable

Depending on your default options,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or
directory.

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Clearing your terminal
>
> If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using the
> `clear` command. You can still access previous commands using <kbd>↑</kbd>
> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line, or by scrolling in your terminal.
{: .callout}

Here,
we can see that our home directory contains only **sub-directories**.
Any names in your output that don't have a classification symbol,
are plain old **files**.


## General syntax of a shell command
Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:

~~~
$ ls -F /
~~~
{: .language-bash}


`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-F` and an
**argument** `/`.
We've already encountered options (also called **switches** or **flags**) which
either start with a single dash (`-`) or two dashes (`--`), and they change the behaviour of a command.
Arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as **parameters**.
A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument: but a
command doesn't always require an argument or an option.

Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
between `ls` and `-F` the shell will look for a command called `ls-F`, which
doesn't exist. Also, capitalization can be important. For example, `ls -s` will display the size of files and directories alongside the names, while `ls -S` will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:

~~~
$ ls -s Desktop/data-shell/data
total 116
 4 amino-acids.txt   4 animals.txt   4 morse.txt  12 planets.txt  76 sunspot.txt
 4 animal-counts     4 elements      4 pdb         4 salmon.txt
$ ls -S Desktop/data-shell/data
sunspot.txt  animal-counts  pdb        amino-acids.txt  salmon.txt
planets.txt  elements       morse.txt  animals.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing
of files and directories in the root directory `/`.
An example of the output you might get from the above command is given below:

~~~
$ ls -F /
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Applications/         System/
Library/              Users/
Network/              Volumes/
~~~
{: .output}

### Getting help

`ls` has lots of other **options**. There are two common ways to find out how
to use a command and what options it accepts:

1. We can pass a `--help` option to the command, such as:
    ~~~
    $ ls --help
    ~~~
    {: .language-bash}

2. We can read its manual with `man`, such as:
    ~~~
    $ man ls
    ~~~
    {: .language-bash}

**Depending on your environment you might find that only one of these works
(either `man` or `--help`, eg. `man` works for macOS and `--help` typically works for Git Bash).**

We'll describe both ways below.

#### The `--help` option

Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a `--help` option to display more
information on how to use the command or program.

~~~
$ ls --help
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                               '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                               1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                               if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
  -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
  -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
  -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
...        ...        ...
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Unsupported command-line options
> If you try to use an option (flag) that is not supported, `ls` and other commands

> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> ~~~
> ls: invalid option -- 'j'
> Try 'ls --help' for more information.
> ~~~

{: .callout}

#### The `man` command

The other way to learn about `ls` is to type
~~~
$ man ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will turn your terminal into a page with a description
of the `ls` command and its options.

To navigate through the `man` pages,
you may use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line,
or try <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to skip up and down by a full page.
To search for a character or word in the `man` pages,
use <kbd>/</kbd> followed by the character or word you are searching for.
Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits.  If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd> (for moving forward) and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (for moving backward).

To **quit** the `man` pages, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.

### Exploring Other Directories

Not only can we use `ls` on the current working directory, but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a
look at our `Desktop` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`,
i.e.,
the command `ls` with the `-F` **option** and the **argument**  `Desktop`.
The argument `Desktop` tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
data-shell/
~~~
{: .output}

Note that if a directory named `Desktop` does not exist in your current working directory
this command will return an error. Typically a `Desktop` directory exists in your 
home directory, which we assume is the current working directory of your bash shell.

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your
Desktop directory, including the `data-shell` directory you downloaded at
the [setup for this lesson]({{ page.root }}{% link setup.md %}).
On many systems,
the command line Desktop directory is the same as your GUI Desktop.
Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that your output is accurate.

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Now that we know the `data-shell` directory is located in our Desktop directory, we
can do two things.

First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name to `ls`:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/
~~~
{: .output}

Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so
we are no longer located in
our home directory.

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for 'change directory',
which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn't change the directory,
it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in. 
The `cd` command is akin to double clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above.  We can
use the following series of commands to get there:

~~~
$ cd Desktop
$ cd data-shell
$ cd data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

These commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop directory, then into
the `data-shell` directory, then into the `data` directory.  You will notice that `cd` doesn't print anything.  This is normal.  Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed.  But if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now
in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data`.
If we run `ls -F` without arguments now,
it lists the contents of `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data`,
because that's where we now are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
amino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/	        salmon.txt
animals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory)
but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)?
We might try the following:

~~~
$ cd data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory
~~~
{: .error}

But we get an error!  Why is this?

With our methods so far,
`cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory.  There are
different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start
with the simplest.

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level
that looks like this:

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`..` is a special directory name meaning
"the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly,
the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .output}

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.  If we want
to display it, we can add the `-a` option to `ls -F`:

~~~
$ ls -F -a
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
./   .bash_profile  data/       north-pacific-gyre/  pizza.cfg  thesis/
../  creatures/     molecules/  notes.txt            solar.pdf  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

`-a` stands for 'show all';
it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/Users/nelle`, refers to the `/Users` directory)
As you can see,
it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means 'the current working directory'.
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined
with a single `-` and no spaces between the options: `ls -F -a` is
equivalent to `ls -Fa`.

These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens
if you type `cd` on its own, without giving
a directory?

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer!

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~
{: .output}

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

~~~
$ cd Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
current location.

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command
like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location  from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by
including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash.  The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from
the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `data-shell` directory from anywhere on
the filesystem (including from inside `data`).  To find the absolute path
we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need
to move to `data-shell`.

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Run `pwd` and `ls -F` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> ## Sorting Output
>
> Nelle names her directories 'year-month-day',
> with leading zeroes for months and days,
> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
> If she used month names,
> December would come before July;
> if she didn't use leading zeroes,
> November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
> means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.
{: .callout}

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as 'NENE01729A'.
This is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

Now in her current directory `data-shell`,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.
If she types:

~~~
$ ls nor
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and then presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on her keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If she presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> again,
Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,
since it's the only possible completion.
Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again does nothing,
since there are 19 possibilities;
pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called **tab completion**,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

- "`rm [path]` removes (deletes) a file."
- "`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`."
- "`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`."

- "The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone."
- "Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
- "Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."

## Creating directories
We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?

### Step one: see where we are and what we already have
Let's go back to our `data-shell` directory on the Desktop
and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

### Create a directory

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

~~~
$ mkdir thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

As you might guess from its name,
`mkdir` means 'make directory'.
Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash, like `/what/ever/thesis`),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  thesis/  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

~~~
$ ls -F thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that `mkdir` is not limited to creating single directories one at a time. The `-p` option allows `mkdir` to create a directory with any number of nested subdirectories in a single operation: 

~~~
$ mkdir -p thesis/chapter_1/section_1/subsection_1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The `-R` option to the `ls` command will list all nested subdirectories wtihin a directory.  Let's use `ls -FR` to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created beneath the `thesis` directory:

~~~
$ ls -FR thesis
chapter_1/

thesis/chapter_1:
section_1/

thesis/chapter_1/section_1:
subsection_1/

thesis/chapter_1/section_1/subsection_1:
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Two ways of doing the same thing
> Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer.
> If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer,
> the `thesis` directory will appear there too.
> While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files,
> the files and directories themselves are the same.
{: .callout}

> ## Good names for files and directories
>
> Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful

{: .callout}

### Create a text file
Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Which Editor?
>
> When we say, '`nano` is a text editor' we really do mean 'text': it can
> only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
> human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the
> least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may
> not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
> after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
> many programmers use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
> [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn),
> or a graphical editor such as
> [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, you may wish to
> use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  Windows also has a built-in
> editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same
> way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.
>
> No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
> for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
> use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
> your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
> documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
> another directory the first time you 'Save As...'
{: .callout}

Let's type in a few lines of text.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk
(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).

<div style="width:80%; margin: auto;"><img alt="Nano in Action" src="../fig/nano-screenshot.png"></div>

Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

> ## Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key
>
> The Control key is also called the 'Ctrl' key. There are various ways
> in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
> see an instruction to press the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down,

> * `Control+X`
> * `Ctrl-X`
> * `Ctrl+X`
> * `^X`
> * `C-x`
>
> In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see `^G Get Help ^O WriteOut`.
> This means that you can use `Control-G` to get help and `Control-O` to save your
> file.
{: .callout}

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

## Moving files and directories
Returning to the `data-shell` directory,

```
cd ~/Desktop/data-shell/
```
{: .language-bash}

In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt`
which isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for 'move':

~~~
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first argument tells `mv` what we're 'moving',
while the second is where it's to go.
In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

One has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
lead to data loss. An additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),
can be used to make `mv` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.

Note that `mv` also works on directories.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename,
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called 'move'.)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

~~~
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Further,
`ls` with a filename or directory name as an argument only lists that file or directory.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is still in our current directory:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Copying files and directories

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given multiple paths at once:

~~~
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

```
$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```
{: .language-bash}

We can check the result by listing the contents of both the `thesis` and `thesis_backup` directory:

```
$ ls thesis thesis_backup
```
{: .language-bash}

```
thesis:
quotations.txt

thesis_backup:
quotations.txt
```
{: .output}

## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `data-shell` directory,
let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created.
The Unix command we'll use for this is `rm` (short for 'remove'):

~~~
$ rm quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We can confirm the file has gone using `ls`:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

```
ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```
{: .output}

If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

~~~
$ rm thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
~~~
{: .error}

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

~~~
$ rm -r thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
`rm -r` *should be used with great caution* (you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).

## Operations with multiple files and directories

Oftentimes one needs to copy or move several files at once. This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames, or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards.

### Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

> ## Wildcards
>
> `*` is a **wildcard**, which matches zero or more  characters.
> Let's consider the `data-shell/molecules` directory:
> `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
> file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches
> `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only
> matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
>
> `?` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
> So `?ethane.pdb` would match `methane.pdb` whereas
> `*ethane.pdb` matches both `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`.
>
> Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
> e.g. `???ane.pdb` matches three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
> giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.
>
> When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
> list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
> asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
> any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
> as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the `molecules` directory
> (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in
> an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`.
> However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of
> file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
> themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
> expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design.

---

Now that we know a few basic commands,
we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:
the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.
We'll start with the directory called `data-shell/molecules`
that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.
The `.pdb` extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,
a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.

~~~
$ ls molecules
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
cubane.pdb    ethane.pdb    methane.pdb
octane.pdb    pentane.pdb   propane.pdb
~~~
{: .output}

Let's go into that directory with `cd` and run an example  command `wc cubane.pdb`:

~~~
$ cd molecules
$ wc cubane.pdb 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
~~~
{: .output}

`wc` is the 'word count' command:
it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files (from left to right, in that order).

If we run the command `wc *.pdb`, the `*` in `*.pdb` matches zero or more characters,
so the shell turns `*.pdb` into a list of all `.pdb` files in the current directory:

~~~
$ wc *.pdb
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
  20  156  1158  cubane.pdb
  12  84   622   ethane.pdb
   9  57   422   methane.pdb
  30  246  1828  octane.pdb
  21  165  1226  pentane.pdb
  15  111  825   propane.pdb
 107  819  6081  total
~~~
{: .output}

Note that `wc *.pdb` also shows the total number of all lines in the last line of the output.

If we run `wc -l` instead of just `wc`,
the output shows only the number of lines per file:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
~~~
{: .output}

The `-m` and `-w` options can also be used with the `wc` command, to show 
only the number of characters or the number of words in the files.

{: .callout}

Which of these files contains the fewest lines?
It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,
but what if there were 6000?
Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The greater than symbol, `>`, tells the shell to **redirect** the command's output
to a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:
everything that `wc` would have printed has gone into the
file `lengths.txt` instead.)  The shell will create
the file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, it will be
silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires
some caution.
`ls lengths.txt` confirms that the file exists:

~~~
$ ls lengths.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
lengths.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We can now send the content of `lengths.txt` to the screen using `cat lengths.txt`.
The `cat` command gets its name from 'concatenate' i.e. join together,
and it prints the contents of files one after another.
There's only one file in this case,
so `cat` just shows us what it contains:

~~~
$ cat lengths.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Output Page by Page

> This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops.
> You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar,
> or back one by pressing `b`.  Press `q` to quit.
{: .callout}

Now let's use the `sort` command to sort its contents.

> ## What Does `sort -n` Do?
>
> If we run `sort` on a file containing the following lines:
>

>

> 19
> 22
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> Explain why `-n` has this effect.
>
> > ## Solution
> > The `-n` option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We will also use the `-n` option to specify that the sort is
numerical instead of alphanumerical.
This does *not* change the file;
instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:

~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total
~~~
{: .output}

We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called `sorted-lengths.txt`
by putting `> sorted-lengths.txt` after the command,
just as we used `> lengths.txt` to put the output of `wc` into `lengths.txt`.
Once we've done that,
we can run another command called `head` to get the first few lines in `sorted-lengths.txt`:

~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
  9  methane.pdb
~~~
{: .output}

Using `-n 1` with `head` tells it that
we only want the first line of the file;
`-n 20` would get the first 20,
and so on.
Since `sorted-lengths.txt` contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,
the output of `head` must be the file with the fewest lines.

If you think this is confusing,
you're in good company:
even once you understand what `wc`, `sort`, and `head` do,
all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.
We can make it easier to understand by running `sort` and `head` together:

~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
  9  methane.pdb
~~~
{: .output}

The vertical bar, `|`, between the two commands is called a **pipe**.
It tells the shell that we want to use
the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.

Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.
That is, we can for example send the output of `wc` directly to `sort`,
and then the resulting output to `head`.
Thus we first use a pipe to send the output of `wc` to `sort`:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
~~~
{: .output}

And now we send the output of this pipe, through another pipe, to `head`, so that the full pipeline becomes:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
   9  methane.pdb
~~~
{: .output}

This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like *log(3x)*
and saying 'the log of three times *x*'.
In our case,
the calculation is 'head of sort of line count of `*.pdb`'.


The redirection and pipes used in the last few commands are illustrated below:

![Redirects and Pipes of different commands: "wc -l *.pdb" will direct the 
output to the shell. "wc -l *.pdb > lengths" will direct output to the file
"lengths". "wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1" will build a pipeline where the
output of the "wc" command is the input to the "sort" command, the output of
the "sort" command is the input to the "head" command and the output of the
"head" command is directed to the shell](../fig/redirects-and-pipes.svg)

This idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful.
Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,
Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,
and that work well with each other.
This programming model is called 'pipes and filters'.
We've already seen pipes;
a **filter** is a program like `wc` or `sort`
that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.
Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:
unless told to do otherwise,
they read from standard input,
do something with what they've read,
and write to standard output.

The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input
and writes lines of text to standard output
can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.
You can *and should* write your programs this way
so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.

## Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files

Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
and created 17 files in the `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03` directory described earlier.
As a quick check, starting from her home directory, Nelle types:

~~~
$ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
$ wc -l *.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The output is 18 lines that look like this:

~~~
300 NENE01729A.txt
300 NENE01729B.txt
300 NENE01736A.txt
300 NENE01751A.txt
300 NENE01751B.txt
300 NENE01812A.txt
... ...
~~~
{: .output}

Now she types this:

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
When she goes back and checks it,
she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning --- someone
was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
and she forgot to reset it.
Before re-running that sample,
she checks to see if any files have too much data:

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
5040 total
~~~
{: .output}

Those numbers look good --- but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?
All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';
by convention,
her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.
To find others like it, she does this:

~~~
$ ls *Z.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Sure enough,
when she checks the log on her laptop,
there's no depth recorded for either of those samples.
Since it's too late to get the information any other way,
she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
She could delete them using `rm`,
but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter,
so instead, she'll have to be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression `*[AB].txt`.
As always,
the `*` matches any number of characters;
the expression `[AB]` matches either an 'A' or a 'B',
so this matches all the valid data files she has.
